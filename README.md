# COMP310_A1
Simple Shell Interface that accepts user commands and executes in separate process.
This was the first assignment in our COMP 310/ECSE 427 class at McGill University, taught by Professor Muthucumaru Maheswaran.
The official project description is included in the mini_PA1.pdf file that is also included in the repository.
This project was an exercise in understanding basic OS process allocation, as well as key OS functions such as fork(), exec(), and wait(). We also had to implement a history feature, output redirection, a method to print background processes, and a method to bring background processes to the foreground.
